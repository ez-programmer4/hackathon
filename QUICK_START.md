## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS

### When judges ask: "How is this different from Jumia/Amazon?"

**Answer**: 
> "Jumia lets anyone sell anything. We only allow verified Academy graduates who've proven they can build quality products. Plus, our AI personalizes the entire marketplace for each user. A farmer sees different products than a doctor. That's the AI difference."

---

### When judges ask: "Is the AI real or just marketing?"

**Answer**: 
> "Let me show you. [Go to marketplace] See this 'AI Recommendation: 92%' badge? The algorithm calculated that based on my profile from registration. It matches my skills (React.js) with products that need React developers, and my interests (Agri-tech) with farm-related products. That's real-time AI scoring for every user-product combination."

---

### When judges ask: "How do you make money?"

**Answer**: 
> "Three ways: 
> 1. Academy enrollment: 600 ETB per student × 10,000 students = 6M ETB Year 1
> 2. Premium seller features: Coming Year 2
> 3. B2B licensing: Universities and corporations
> 
> We're profitable at scale with clear path to $200K ARR."

---

### When judges ask: "Can this scale?"

**Answer**: 
> "Absolutely. The model works anywhere with universities and aspiring entrepreneurs. Ethiopia first, then Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana. Any emerging market needs this."
