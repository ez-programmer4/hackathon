2. **Compatible Work Styles**
   - Structured person + Flexible person = Good
   - Both super structured = Might clash

3. **Communication Alignment**
   - Daily communicator + Async worker = Potential issue
   - Both prefer regular check-ins = Perfect

4. **Risk Balance**
   - Both high risk = Dangerous
   - One high, one moderate = Balanced team

5. **Resilience Mix**
   - All team needs high resilience
   - Filters out those who can't handle pressure

## 🤖 AI INTEGRATION

### How Behavioral Data Powers Matching:

```
User A Profile:
- Motivation: 95 (very high)
- Leadership: 90 (strong leader)
- Risk: 85 (high tolerance)
- Teamwork: 70 (moderate)

AI Matches With:

User B:
- Motivation: 90 (aligned!)
- Leadership: 60 (follower - complementary!)
- Risk: 70 (balanced - good!)
- Teamwork: 95 (strong - fills gap!)

Match Score: 92% ✅
